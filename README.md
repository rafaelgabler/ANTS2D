# ANTS2D

Numerical simulation of ants searching for food in a 2D board based on the paper published by Nishinari et al. (2006) on 
Physica A: "Modelling of self-driven particles: Foraging ants and pedestrians". This is a FORTRAN code designed to simulate 
the behavior of ants searching for food in a 2D board. The program was designed just for fun, but it could be useful to 
develop reallistic simulations of general problems involving self-driven particles. 

I recorded a Youtube video in my channel (in portuguese) explaining the logic and the ideas behind this code, here is the 
link for anyone interested:
